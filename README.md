# maze

To run the jar file, download and extract the zip.

Change into the directory it creates.
There is a subdirectory called files/mazes.txt in that directory, along with a file called Maze.jar.

You must have Java 1.8 installed.

At a command line, type:

java -jar Maze.jar

The source files are in the Maze_full.zip file.  They won't compile as is, because the org.jetbrains libraries are not included.  I will try to find those tomorrow and upload a new version of the source.  Those libraries were part of my IDE.
